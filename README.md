## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML** for the basic structure.
- **CSS** for the design and layout.
- **JavaScript** for dark mode and lazy loading.

### What I Learned

- How to load images only when they are needed, which speeds up the page.
- How to add dark mode and save the user's preference.

### Future Plans

- Add more animations to make the gallery more interactive.
- Improve the websiteâ€™s accessibility so everyone can use it easily.
- Try loading images and messages from a server instead of storing them locally.

### Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) - Helped me learn about lazy loading.
- [CSS Tricks - Dark Mode](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) - Guided me in setting up dark mode.
